    "So far, we have explored the differences between deep learning models and traditional software. Now let's think about one of the main topics in this course: how to improve the quality of machine learning systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let's first review the developing process of classical software:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Software development --> Software testing --> Software debugging --> Software development.`\n",
    "\n",
    "And machine learning systems have similar process:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Model training --> Model evaluation --> Model debugging/ Architecture improvement --> Model (re)training.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally Model evaluation is done by testing on test set. Similar to the software testing procedure, this is a very important step towards quality assurance of DL models. However, there are multiple questions remaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The size of the test set is usually limited, because it could be expensive to collect data with labeled data. Hence it's hard to cover all the corner cases in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. To solve this problem, we need to develop a method to generate more test cases. \n",
    "    b. Like test generation in traditional automated software testing, we need to generate \"valid\" test cases. For example, you can not generate a cat image to test the handwritten digit recognition system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let's suppose that you now have a large enough test set. The next question is, how can we tell whether the ML system has been comprehensively tested or not. Or, in other words, what is the criteria to stop the testing and how to measure whether the ML system has been well-tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The \"code coverage\" metric is usually used in traditional software, and we also have practiced it in the last assignment. If we know that every logical branch in the software has been covered in the testing, we can be more confident to say that this software has been comprehensive tested.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Now if you have a testing metric like \"code coverage\" and a test case generation method for testing machine learning systems, the next step is to generate as diverse test cases as you can to improve the testing coverage. Is it possible to \"guide\" the test case generation process instead of do it randomly?\n",
